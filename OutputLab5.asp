    <h1>OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS</h1>
   <p>I have worked on two functionalities 1) Supplier Registration 2) Search Product</p><br>

    <h2><u>Supplier Registration</u></h2>
    <p>New supplier can be registered and can be added to the data base by adding its details here on the web page. This screenshot shows that i filled the feilds.</p><br>

    <h2><u>Supplier Registered Successfully</u></h2>
   <p>This screen shot shows that the supplier has been registered to our system successfully.</p><br>

  <h2><u>Supplier Added to DataBase</u></h2>
   <p>Here i verified that new supplier that registered just now is added to our data base or not. For that i used SQL command select * from Supplier_t in the SSMS and the table from the DB shows that new supplier has been added.</p><br>

<h2><u>Search Product</u></h2>
   <p>The product can be searched by typing initial letters of it. I have implemented this functionality such that even if you write initial letters of your product name it will still search and display it because i used the keyword LIKE to implement it.</p><br>
