    <h2><u>IAD Problem Statement</u></h2>

    <p>
        Consider the Pine Valley Furniture Company database designed and implemented using structured query language during previous semester.
        Try to recall major relations in the database (CUSTOMER_T, ORDER_T, ORDER_LINE_T, and PRODUCT_T).
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a need to implement a web based solution for above mentioned database. The web based solution must incorporate following functionalities:
    </p>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>New Customer Registration</li>
        <li>Searching of Products</li>
        <li>Products Selection and Order Placement</li>
        <li>Product Catalog Update</li>
        <li>Payment Provision</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As a first step design above mentioned (i) to (v) user interfaces using paper and pencil.</p>

    <p>Next write appropriate html for creating (i) to (v) user interface prototypes.</p>

    <p>Create links for navigation among above pages.</p>

    <p>Design a menu using list and styles.</p>

    <p>Add help pages for user guidance.</p>

    <p>Either use table for layout or may opt for flow based layout.</p>

    <p>Test user interface prototypes in browser.</p>

    <p>Experiment with style sheets.</p>

    <br>

    <h2><u>Moving towards Business Intelligence</u></h2>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>Try to transform order processing system into a customer segmentation analysis platform.</li>
        <li>How user profiling can be added into basic order processing system?</li>
        <li>How targeted marketing can be realized?</li>
    </ol>
