  <p><strong>Consider the database development project developed during previous semester.</strong> A complete database design and development was carried out in previous semester project as detailed in your project report in printed form.</p>

  <p>In addition during one of previous labs (see reference below) you were required to develop web interfaces on paper and then develop html prototypes for various functionalities of your database project mentioned as above.</p>

  <p>Now the next task is to transform paper based and html based prototype interfaces into full scale working web forms for realization of various functionalities of your project. Ideally you are required to develop all web forms for implementing various project functionalities.</p>

  <p><strong>Reference: Lab 3 Q1)</strong> Consider the project database designed and implemented during previous semester i.e. Fall 2024.</p>

  <p>Its implementation was done using structured query language during previous semester. Try to recall major relations in your project database. You already have its report in printed form.</p>

  <p>There is a need to implement a web based solution for above mentioned database. The web based solution must incorporate various functionalities of your project.</p>

  <p>(1) Registration of Student/Patient/Passenger/Customer, or whatever is applicable in your project.</p>
  <p>(2) Search facilities including partial matches</p>
  <p>(3) Any other project specific functionalities</p>
  <p>(4) Role based access control</p>
  <p>(5) Payment system (if required)</p>

  <p>As a first step design above mentioned (i) to (v) user interfaces using paper and pencil.<br>
  Next write appropriate html for creating (i) to (v) user interface prototypes.<br>
  Create links for navigation among above pages.<br>
  Design a menu using list and styles.<br>
  Add help pages for user guidance.<br>
  Either use table for layout or may opt for flow based layout.<br>
  Test user interface prototypes in browser.<br>
  Experiment with style sheets.</p>

  <p>
    You are strictly advised to refrain from using any AI tool during lab work. (0 score will be given for any such effort). Just follow codes as listed in book or as demonstrated in class from time to time.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Q1)</strong> Write code (<em>code behind only</em>) for any two of the interfaces below?</p>
  <p><strong>Q2)</strong> Draw corresponding graphical user interface as rendered in browser?</p>
